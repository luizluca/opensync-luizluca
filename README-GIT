This is the git tree fork of the OpenSync SVN tree.  The aim is to
include the pertinent changes seen on the SVN tree, but changes to
this tree may not necessarily get pushed back to SVN.

Git does not have the same concept as SVN externals, so the cmake
modules are not included automatically, as done for SVN.

To build the git trees, clone the cmake-modules-cdf tree with:

	git clone git://repo.or.cz/opensync/cmake-modules-cdf.git

Then add the following option to your cmake command when building opensync:

	-DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/path/to/cmake-modules-cdf

You will need to do this for all plugins that you compile from git.
