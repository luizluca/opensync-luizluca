Changes to the API since version 0.39:
======================================

API Additions:
--------------
	- exposed osync_objtype_sink_get_userdata() as public API call

API Removals:
-------------


API Changes:
------------
	- changed behaviour and prototype of osync_capability_new(),
		which now does not add itself to an OSyncCapabilitiesObjType
		automatically, and must be unref() by the caller as usual
		for _new() functions
		Note that this does not have much impact on usage, since
		capabilities are usually accessed through _parse(), which
		will do the OSyncCapabilitiesObjType add instead.
	- changed behaviour only of osync_capabilities_add_objtype() and
		osync_capabilities_objtype_add_capability(), which
		now ref the objects as they add them to the list
