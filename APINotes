Changes to the API since version 0.39:
======================================

API Additions:
--------------
	- exposed as public API call
		- osync_objtype_sink_get_userdata()
	- added:
		osync_capabilities_add_new_objtype
		osync_capabilities_add_new_capability


API Removals:
-------------
	- hid following as internal functions, and they all have consistent
	  _new() style behaviour
		- osync_capabilities_objtype_new
		- osync_capabilities_objtype_ref
		- osync_capabilities_objtype_unref
		- osync_capability_new
		- osync_capability_ref
		- osync_capability_unref


API Changes:
------------
	- changed behaviour only of osync_capabilities_add_objtype() and
		osync_capabilities_objtype_add_capability(), which
		now ref the objects as they add them to the list
	- [internal] changed capability-related _parse() and _parse_and_add()
		functions, to behave consistently, returning ref'd objects now.
